# **Assembly-on-AppleSiliconMac-ARM64**

Apple migrated the Mac architecture from intel's AMD64 architecture to ARM AArch64 architecture. This series, aimed at developers using Apple Silicon Macs, provides a systematic introduction to assembly language for the AArch64 architecture.This series aims to enable developers with no exposure to assembly language to read and write assembly language, write some high-performance code in assembly language, and read and understand the inverse of binary software. Only the AArch64 architecture is used with the macOS operating system. Therefore, in this series of articles, most of the knowledge is about concepts applicable across systems and platforms, and some ideas unique to macOS will not be highlighted. But don't worry. This seriesâ€™s processes and steps can be performed natively on macOS.

# **Required Basic knowledge**

* C Programming language
* Computer Organization and Architecture Themes and Variations
* if you read the book CS.APP ahead, you can get better understanding
